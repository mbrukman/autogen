# autogen

Automatically generate boilerplate comments and code for new files with a single
command.

Usage:

```bash
autogen -c [copyright holder] -l [license] [filename]
```

Modify an existing file in-place:

```bash
autogen -i [...other params as above...]
```

To get a list of supported licenses, or to see the full set of flags, run
`autogen` with no parameters.

File type or language is determined based on the full filename or extension, as
appropriate. See [`autogen`](autogen) for a list of recognized file types.

Sample outputs:

* [Apache 2.0, Haskell](testdata/apache-acme-hs.out)
* [3-clause BSD, Erlang](testdata/bsd3-acme-erl.out)
* [GPL 2, Ruby](testdata/gpl2-acme-rb.out)
* [LGPL 2.1, C++](testdata/lgpl2.1-acme-cpp.out)
* [MIT, Makefile](testdata/mit-acme-makefile.out)

## Editor support

For details on adding Autogen support to your editor, please see
the [`editors`](editors) directory.

## Developing

To add a new file type or feature, change [`autogen`](autogen) and add
several files to the [`tests/testdata`](tests/testdata) directory, namely:

* `<feature>.in` - the input file containing command-line args to pass
  to `autogen`
* `<feature>.out` - expected stdout for the test
* `<feature>.err` - expected stderr for the test

To generate the `*.out` and `*.err` files automatically, just add the `*.in`
files and run `make regen`. Then, examine the resulting `*.out` and `*.err`
files.

Other custom tests can be added as separate scripts in the [`tests`](tests)
directory. If the file has the suffix `_test.sh`, it will be automatically
picked up by [`tests/run_all_tests.sh`](tests/run_all_tests.sh) script, which
means that `make test` will automatically run it without any other changes.

Be sure to also add an entry for it in [`tests/BUILD`](tests/BUILD) file for
Bazel to be able to run it as well, including appropriate dependencies on any
data files it may need.

## Testing

You have two options:

* via [Bazel](http://bazel.io/): `bazel test //...`
* via Make: `make test`

Bazel is typically faster, especially when rerunning tests, due to built-in
caching.
